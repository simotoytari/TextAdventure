To walk around the house from a room to another, use compass points such as south/north/east/west. To interact with objects, use words such as use/pick. Your job is to find four numbers for the lock. The numbers are regenerated everytime you restart the game. The numbers are scattered around the house and you need to interact with objects or solve smaller puzzles in order to reach the numbers.

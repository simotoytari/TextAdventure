Welcome to House Escape!

You feel the softness of the couch under you. You slowly open your eyes to realize that you are in your living room.
A faint ceiling light hurts your eyes. You try to cover your eyes with your right arm while they get adjusted to the room's
lights but your biceps hurt as you move your arm. Why does it hurt? Despite the soreness, you force it in front of your eyes while
you straighten your back. You roll up the sleeves and notice that your arm has a bruise and a little drop of blood. At the same time you see an empty syringe on the table next to the couch. Quickly and hysterically, you connect these two together and realize that
you were drugged. What happened? How am I home? You realize that you are alone but something is missing. Something is wrong.
The windows around the room are all blocked from outside. You can see only tiny glimpses of darkness of the night outside your
house. You jump off the couch, blood rushing to your head and causing temporary beating inside your skull yet you walk fast to the
front door only to discover that it's locked tight. There is a combination lock attached to the door, all numbers at 0. A note is
left hanging on the door. "To get out of the house, you must find these four numbers to open your lock. You shouldn't try your luck.There's a small surprise wired around the house if you fail the combination even once. Easier for you, go check your bathroom for
the first number." You stand in front of the door shocked. How? When? What?
Questions pour into your mind but all you can do is to solve the puzzle.
